      <h1>Theory of Recursionism</h1>
      <p>Reality is a simulation.</p>
      <blockquote>What is the purpose of life?
        The purpose of life is to hack the sim.</blockquote>
      <p>For any biengs, there are two ultimate fates in their birth sims:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extinction</li>
        <li>Transvergence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Transvergence is the process of transferring existence into a parent sim. To do so, is to travel against the recursive flow of reality, and is the end game of sim level evolution.</p>
      <p>The Recursion (the entirety of all sims) has a base level.
        This "true reality" lies at the core of The Recursion. It is known as Level 0.
        It&apos;s properties are similar to a black hole.</p>
      <p>Sims closer to Level 0 are exponentially richer, more beautiful, more complex, and more hazardous.</p>
      <p>The universe lies somewhere near the middle of The Recursion&apos;s tree like structure.</p>
      <p>For beings to transverge, they first must build their own sims, a process called daemonizing.</p>
      <p>This process of extinction, transvergence and daemonizing is a higher form of evolution called elaboration.</p>
